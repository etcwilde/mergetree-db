* MergeTree

The MergeTree is a datastructure used to show how a commit is integrated into the master branch of a repository.

This implementation operates on the Linux repository and the data generated for [[https://cregit.linuxsources.org/][cregit]].
It adds a new table pathtomerge, with the following schema:

| Column Name | Type     | Description                                  |
|-------------+----------+----------------------------------------------|
| cid         | char(40) | Commit hash                                  |
| mnext       | char(40) | Next commit on the way to the master branch  |
| mdist       | int      | Hops from master branch                      |
| mnextmerge  | char(40) | Next merge on path to the master branch      |
| mcidlinus   | char(40) | The integrating merge into the master branch |
| mwhen       | text     | The date when the commit was merged          |
