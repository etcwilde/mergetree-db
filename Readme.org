* MergeTree

The MergeTree is a datastructure used to show how a commit is integrated into the master branch of a repository.

This implementation operates on the Linux repository and the data generated for [[https://cregit.linuxsources.org/][cregit]].
It adds a new table pathtomerge, with the following schema:

| Column Name | Type     | Description                                 |
|-------------+----------+---------------------------------------------|
| cid         | char(40) | Commit hash                                 |
| next        | char(40) | Next commit on the way to the master branch |
| dist        | int      | Hops from the master branch                 |
| master      | char(40) | Integrating merge into the master branch    |


* Cregit

Cregit is a project designed to show who is contributing code to the kernel. ~git blame~ shows some, but only at the line-level. Cregit digs deeper, breaking the patch down to the token level, giving a much finer-grained account of the changes being made.

This implementation of the MergeTree uses the database generated for Cregit to provide information on the merge trees. Cregit uses the ~slickGitLog~ component to generate the database.

The generated database produces 4 tables:

- commits
- parents
- logs
- footers

** Commits

Commits contains the metadata for each commit in the repository.

| Column Name | Type     | Description                                                   |
|-------------+----------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
| cid         | char(40) | Commit hash                                                   |
| autname     | text     | Author's name                                                 |
| autemail    | text     | Author's email                                                |
| autdate     | text     | Date commit was authored 'year-month-day hour:minute:second'  |
| comname     | text     | Committer's name                                              |
| comemail    | text     | Committer's email                                             |
| comdate     | text     | Date commit was committed 'year-month-day hour:minute:second' |
| summary     | text     | Commit log summary                                            |
| ismerge     | boolean  | Is commit a merge commit?                                     |


** Parents

Contains the repository graph structure. This is the main table used for generating the merge trees.

| Column Name | Type     | Description          |
|-------------+----------+----------------------|
| cid         | char(40) | Commit hash          |
| idx         | integer  | ???                  |
| parent      | char(40) | Parent's commit hash |

~idx~ is necessary for the primary key since some merges merge the same commit twice. It's weird and doesn't make any sense, but it happens.

** logs

Contains the information about the logs.

| Column Name | Type     | Description                 |
|-------------+----------+-----------------------------|
| cid         | char(40) | Commit hash                 |
| log         | text     | The full commit log message |

This is kept as a separate table from ~commits~ since some commit messages are very long.

** footers

Contains information on who is signing off on commits.

| Column Name | Type     | Description                           |
|-------------+----------+---------------------------------------|
| cid         | char(40) | Commit hash                           |
| idx         | integer  | ???                                   |
| key         | text     | The type of information in the footer |
| value       | text     | The actual information                |

An example of a ~key~ might be: "Signed-off-by" and the ~value~ might be "Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>".
